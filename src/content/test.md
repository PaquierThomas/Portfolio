summary:
While choosing to upgrade the game to a Stadia-supported UE4 version was
a great way to minimize the risk of delaying the product, we still
needed to act wisely to speed up our development process.
paragraph: - 'We properly organized our Gitlab repository so developers could commit code to a test branch first and push it to the main branch only after it successfully passes the review. We also created a wiki to share information with our team and make new people quickly jump into the project. We worked efficiently during development as well. For example, Dontnod implemented a custom engine to achieve cinema-quality 3D animation. Given that the conventional way of porting this functionality to a new platform would not allow us to achieve the desired acceleration in delivery, we optimized our pipeline to decrease the amount of work needed to move the animation to the new platforms.' - 'We properly organized our Gitlab repository so developers could commit code to a test branch first and push it to the main branch only after it successfully passes the review.
