  summary:
    While choosing to upgrade the game to a Stadia-supported UE4 version was
    a great way to minimize the risk of delaying the product, we still
    needed to act wisely to speed up our development process.
  paragraph:
    - 'We properly organized our Gitlab repository so developers could commit code to a test branch first and push it to the main branch only after it successfully passes the review. We also created a wiki to share information with our team and make new people quickly jump into the project. We worked efficiently during development as well. For example, Dontnod implemented a custom engine to achieve cinema-quality 3D animation. Given that the conventional way of porting this functionality to a new platform would not allow us to achieve the desired acceleration in delivery, we optimized our pipeline to decrease the amount of work needed to move the animation to the new platforms.'
    - 'Initially, Square Enix wanted to ramp up our team at Dragons Lake gradually to tackle increasing complexity. But because we did a great job at organizing and managing our work process, they decided to get a bigger team from the start. Life Is Strange 2 game porting was handled by a team of several engineers working in parallel to build independent game modules. We established goals, tracked progress, and accomplished project objectives in a timely manner. In fact, our approach to work and effective risk management resulted in a fast time to market. We accomplished major milestones ahead of schedule and spent the rest of the time fixing bugs and optimizing performance.'
